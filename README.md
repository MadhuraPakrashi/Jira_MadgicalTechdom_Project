The provided code is a Python script that interacts with Jira, a project management and issue tracking tool. It uses the Flask framework to create a web application that fetches and manages Jira tickets.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

    1. The necessary libraries are imported, including base64, requests, json, Flask, and mysql.connector.

    2. An instance of the Flask application is created.

    3. The code defines a class called Jira, which encapsulates methods to interact with Jira tickets.

    4. The Jira class constructor initializes various attributes, including Jira credentials, API endpoints, MySQL database connection details, and page variables.

    5. The get_issues method retrieves Jira tickets using a provided JQL (Jira Query Language) query. It makes paginated requests to the Jira API and returns a list of issues.

    6. The show_previous_page and show_next_page methods update the current page number and retrieve Jira tickets from the database based on the specified number of results per page.

    7. The get_tickets_from_database method retrieves Jira tickets from a MySQL database. It accepts the number of results per page and the current page number as parameters.

    8. The get_all_jira_tickets method fetches all Jira tickets from the Jira API and returns them as a list.

    9. The change_ticket_status method updates the status of a ticket from "Open" to "Close" in Jira using the API. It requires the ticket key and a comment.

    10. The fetch_and_store_tickets method fetches Jira tickets from the Jira API and stores them in a MySQL database. It also updates existing tickets in the database if they already exist.

    11. The get_total_pages method calculates the total number of pages based on the number of results per page.

    12. An instance of the Jira class is created.

    13. The Flask route '/' is defined. It handles requests to display Jira tickets. It retrieves the specified number of results per page and current page number from the query parameters. If the fetch_tickets query parameter is present, it fetches and stores Jira tickets before redirecting to the same page. It also handles previous and next page navigation.

    14. Finally, the Flask application is run in debug mode if the script is executed directly.

The code sets up a web application that allows users to view and manage Jira tickets through a browser interface. It fetches tickets from the Jira API, stores them in a MySQL database, and provides pagination functionality for navigating through the tickets.
