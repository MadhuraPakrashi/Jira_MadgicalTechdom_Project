The code consists of a Python Flask application that interacts with Jira and a MySQL database to retrieve and manage Jira tickets. The main components of the code are as follows:

    1. Importing necessary libraries: The required libraries for the code are imported, including base64, requests, json, requests.auth, Flask, and mysql.connector.

    2. Flask Application Initialization: An instance of the Flask application is created.

    3. Jira Class: The code defines a Jira class that provides methods to retrieve and manage Jira tickets.

    a. Constructor (__init__): The constructor initializes the Jira class and sets up the Jira credentials, MySQL database connection, and page variables.

    b. get_issues Method: This method retrieves Jira issues (tickets) based on the provided JQL (Jira Query Language). It retrieves the issues in batches and handles pagination if the total number of issues exceeds the maximum results per page.

    c. show_previous_page and show_next_page Methods: These methods handle the navigation between pages by updating the current page number and retrieving the tickets for the previous or next page from the database.

    d. get_tickets_from_database Method: This method retrieves tickets from the MySQL database based on the page number and results per page. It calculates the total number of pages and uses SQL queries to fetch the relevant tickets from the database.

    e. get_all_jira_tickets Method: This method retrieves all Jira tickets using the Jira API and inserts them into the MySQL database. It fetches tickets in batches, stores relevant ticket information in a dictionary, and inserts the data into the database using SQL queries.

    f. change_ticket_status Method: This method updates the status of a Jira ticket from 'Open' to 'Closed' and adds a comment using the Jira API. It sends a POST request to the Jira API endpoint with the ticket key and the desired status transition ID.

    4. Flask Routes: The code defines a single route ("/") that handles the display of tickets in the Flask application.

    a. show_tickets Route: This route is triggered when the application root ("/") is accessed. It retrieves the desired number of tickets per page from the query parameters, calls the get_tickets_from_database method to fetch the tickets from the database, and renders a template to display the tickets.

    5. Application Execution: The code sets the Flask application to run in debug mode and starts the application.

Overall, the code provides functionality to interact with the Jira API, retrieve Jira tickets, store them in a MySQL database, and display the tickets in a web interface using Flask.
