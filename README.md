    A breakdown of the code is given: 
    1. The necessary libraries are imported: tkinter for GUI, base64 for encoding Jira credentials, requests for making HTTP requests, json for working with JSON data, and mysql.connector for interacting with MySQL database.
  
    2. The Jira class is defined, which provides methods for retrieving and managing Jira tickets.

    3. The Jira class constructor (init) initializes the GUI window and sets up Jira credentials and MySQL database connection.

    4. Various GUI elements such as labels, buttons, and listbox are created using tkinter.

    5. The Jira class provides methods for fetching Jira tickets, displaying them in the GUI, and interacting with the MySQL database.

    6. The script creates two instances of the Jira class, each associated with a different tkinter root window.

    7. The methods of the Jira object are called to interact with Jira and the MySQL database, such as retrieving tickets, showing previous/next pages, and getting all Jira tickets.
