The provided code is a Python script that includes several libraries and defines a Flask application for managing Jira tickets. Here's a breakdown of its components:

    1. Importing necessary libraries: The script imports various libraries including base64, requests, json, requests.auth, Flask, and mysql.connector.

    2. Creating a Flask application instance: An instance of the Flask application is created with the name app.

    3. Jira class: This class represents a Jira ticket management system. It includes methods for retrieving and managing Jira tickets. It also establishes a connection to a MySQL database.

    4. Flask route: The script defines a route in the Flask application using the @app.route() decorator. The route is set to the root path ("/").

    5. show_tickets(): This function is associated with the defined route. It retrieves the number of results per page from the request parameters and uses the Jira class to fetch and store the tickets in the MySQL database. It then renders the "tickets.html" template with the retrieved tickets and the specified number of results per page.

    6. Jira class methods: The Jira class includes several methods:
        a. __init__(): Initializes the Jira class, sets up Jira credentials and MySQL database connection.
        b. get_issues(): Retrieves Jira tickets by sending requests to the Jira API and returns the fetched issues.
        c. show_previous_page(): Decreases the current page number and returns the tickets from the database for the updated page.
        d. show_next_page(): Increases the current page number and returns the tickets from the database for the updated page.
        e. get_tickets_from_database(): Retrieves tickets from the MySQL database based on the specified number of results per page and current page.
        f. get_all_jira_tickets(): Retrieves all Jira tickets, inserts them into the MySQL database, and updates existing tickets.
        g. change_ticket_status(): Changes the status of a Jira ticket and adds a comment using the Jira API.
        h. fetch_and_store_tickets(): Fetches and stores Jira tickets into the MySQL database, truncating the existing data.


    6. Instantiating the Jira class: An instance of the Jira class is created.

    7. Flask application execution: The Flask application is run by calling app.run(), allowing the script to be executed as a standalone application.
