The code consists of a Python Flask application that interacts with Jira and a MySQL database to retrieve and manage Jira tickets. The main components of the code are as follows:
    1. Importing necessary libraries:
        base64: For encoding Jira credentials.
        requests: For making HTTP requests to the Jira API.
        json: For handling JSON data.
        requests.auth: For HTTP authentication.
        Flask: For creating a web application.
        mysql.connector: For connecting and interacting with the MySQL database.

    2. Creating a Flask application instance:
        An instance of the Flask application is created with the name app.

    3. Class Jira:
       This class provides methods to retrieve and manage Jira tickets.
    3.1. Initialization (__init__ method):

        Sets the Jira URL, Jira credentials, MySQL database connection details, and page-related variables.

    3.2. Method get_issues:
        Retrieves Jira issues based on the JQL query, max results, and start index.
        Makes HTTP requests to the Jira API using the provided credentials.
        Returns a list of retrieved issues.

    3.3. Method show_previous_page:
        Decreases the current page number and retrieves tickets from the database for the previous page.

    3.4. Method show_next_page:
        Increases the current page number and retrieves tickets from the database for the next page.

    3.5. Method get_tickets_from_database:
        Retrieves tickets from the MySQL database based on the page number and results per page.
        Returns a list of tickets retrieved from the database.

    3.6. Method get_all_jira_tickets:
        Retrieves all Jira tickets using pagination and inserts them into the MySQL database.

    3.7. Method change_ticket_status:
        Changes the status of a Jira ticket from 'Open' to 'Closed' using the Jira API.
        Updates the ticket status and adds a comment.

    3.8. Method fetch_and_store_tickets:
        Fetches new tickets from Jira and stores them in the MySQL database.
        Clears existing tickets from the database before inserting new ones.

    Flask route '/':
        This route is the root route of the Flask application.

    4.1. Function show_tickets:
        Retrieves the results_per_page_entry value from the query parameters.
        Calls the get_tickets_from_database method to retrieve tickets from the database based on the page number and results per page.
        Checks if the "Fetch Tickets" button was clicked and fetches new tickets from Jira if so.
        Renders the 'tickets.html' template with the retrieved tickets.

    Main execution:
        The script runs the Flask application if executed directly.
